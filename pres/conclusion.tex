	\frametitle{Conclusion}
		The neutron group fluxes and reactivity coefficients from Moltres
		(without \gls{DNP} drift) are in
		good agreement with Serpent results, in the context of the \gls{MSFR}.
		
		\vspace{.3cm}
		The steady state neutron flux, temperature, and \gls{DNP} distributions
		observed are expected for uniform flow.
		
		\vspace{.3cm}
		Discrepancies in peak neutron
		flux and temperature distributions to other work are primarily due to
		the minor differences in core geometry and using uniform flow instead of
		appling a turbulence model.
		
		\vspace{.3cm}
		Higher core temperatures observed for start-up fuel composition than
		early-life and equilibrium compositions.
		
		\vspace{.3cm}
		Discrepancy in average core temperatures during \gls{ULOHS} is mainly due
		to the lack of a decay heat model in Moltres.
